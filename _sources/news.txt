.. note:: Here we will describe new information regarding VoSeq, as well as list
          changes in new versions of the software.

Launched pre-release version 2.0.0-beta. This is a complete rewrite of the source
code in Python. Faster, better, modular.

As of version 1.5.0 we have implemented more information to be stored and used
for genes and alignments!

    * For example introns (or other non-wanted regions), and genetic codes and
      reading frames for protein coding genes are now set for each gene.
    * Now can also gene tables be made with characteristics for each
      gene/alignment (for chosen taxonset) such as length, gene type, parsimony
      informative sites, nucleotide content etc.

We have tried out a perhaps easier way of installation for Apache, MySQL and PHP
with the XAMPP package (http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html).
See installation instructions for windows systems. Hope it makes things easier!
